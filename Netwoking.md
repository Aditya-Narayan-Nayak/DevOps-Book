# What is TCP/Ip thing?
for an example we are sending a file One Person to another person So there are Diffrent type of file we are sending And We need Internet to transfer full data or half data
- Like If we are sending a .doc file We Need The Output shold be the Full File Without Any Loss 
- if we are video sending from 1 place to another We Didn't require Full Data to be Shared If Frame Drop happen. It should Not be a problem.
