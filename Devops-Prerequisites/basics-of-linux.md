2. Open Source – Linux is open-source software. The code used to create Linux is free and available to the public to view, edit, and—for users with the appropriate skills—to contribute to.

3. Secure – Once you have Linux installed on your system, there is no need to use an antivirus! Linux is a highly secure system. Moreover, there is a global development community constantly looking at ways to enhance its security. Each upgrade makes the OS becomes more secure and robust.

4. Stability and Performance – Linux provides very high stability i.e. it does not need a reboot after a short period of time. Your Linux system rarely slows down or freezes.You can work without any disturbance on your Linux systems. Linux provides remarkably high performance on various networks and workstations.
